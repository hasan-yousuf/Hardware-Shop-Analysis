In this project, I have designed and implemented a comprehensive database system for a hardware company's product sales analysis. The database includes multiple tables, views, stored procedures, and triggers to efficiently manage and analyze sales data over multiple fiscal years. Core tables have been created to store monthly sales data, gross price information, customer details, and product information.

Views were thoughtfully designed to simplify complex queries and provide easy access to critical information for decision-making, not limited to any specific fiscal year.

Stored procedures were implemented to generate monthly sales reports for specific customers and to create financial reports for different markets within any fiscal year. These reports help the company in understanding sales trends, identifying top-performing markets and customers, and making data-driven business decisions.

To ensure data accuracy and streamline the forecasting process, triggers were used to handle potential errors and to maintain up-to-date information. This ensures more accurate sales forecasting and improves overall data integrity.

Overall, this database system aims to provide valuable insights into the company's sales performance, enhance decision-making capabilities, and optimize sales strategies for the hardware company in the competitive market landscape, covering data from multiple fiscal years.
